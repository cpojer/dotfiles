## KeyBindings

Move folder to `~/Library/Application Support` to avoid alt-space spitting out non-breaking spaces when using German or other keyboard layouts.

## Install

- `./bootstrap`
- `./homebrew`
- See `./sublime/setup` and `vscode/setup` for how to symlink the dotfiles folder into the Sublime Text and VS Code user folders. Note that you'll need to delete the existing `User` folders within the respective `Application Support` folders first.
